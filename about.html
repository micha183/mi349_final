                <h2>Who is Jacob Michaels?</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Jacob, and I'm currently a senior at Michigan State University pursuing a major in Information Science, with a minor in Information Technology.
                    I first began my data science journey my junior year of college, when I decided to switch my major to Information Science, and also declare a minor in 
                    Information Technology. This is about the time I began getting interested in Data Science and Machine Learning. After taking some Data Analysis courses,
                    I decided to begin looking for internships. Luckily, after a few interviews, I was hired at Little Caesars as a Data Analyst! Over the summer we worked
                    on an important machine learning model that tracked store cannibalization (not as violent as it sounds). I was lucky enough for them to extend my internship
                    into the Fall and Spring. I pick up new skills and learn every day.
                </p>
                <p>Data Science isn't my only hobby, believe it or not. I also enjoy to produce music such as instrumentals or edm tracks. I've been doing this for a few years,
                    so I like to think that I'm not too bad! I enjoy being able to have a creative outlet such as this so that I can make stuff I'm proud of and enjoy. I also love to
                    ski. Living in Michigan, I had to find a way to make Winter not so miserable. Skiing gives me a reason to actually look forward to winter and snow! When theres a 
                    snowstorm on the forecast, I get excited, whereas most people may be turned off by the snow. That's partially the reason I chose this picture of me for my website 
                    profile picture.
                </p>
                <p>I hope you've enjoyed the Data Research projects I've chosen to display in this website, and please feel free to send me an email of future research you would find 
                    interesting.
                </p>
                <p>Thanks!</p>
